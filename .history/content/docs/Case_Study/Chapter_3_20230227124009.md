## Spatial Data Science 

Spatial data science is a relatively new field of study that combines the fields of statistics, computer science, and geography. Spatial data science is a broad field that includes many different types of analysis. In this chapter, we will focus on the analysis of point and raster data. 

## Objectives 

The objective of the third *Case Study* is to demonstrate the practical application of the common spatial data structures and operation with GPU-accelerated Python packages. The goal here is in twofold: 1) compare the computational speed of calculating point in polygon and 2) compare the computational speed of a classification model with raster data. 

## Case Study 3: Predicting the Presence of Aedes aegypti 

In this case study, we will be predicting the global presence and probability of Aedes aegypti, a mosquito species that is known to transmit dengue fever, chikungunya, and Zika virus. The data used in this case study is from the, 

We are also using four environmental variables to predict the presence of Aedes aegypti. These variables are:  1) the mean annual temperature, 2) the mean annual precipitation, 3) the mean annual solar radiation, and 4) the mean annual relative humidity. 

### Loading datasets 

### Data Visualization 

### Preparing data for pseudo-background points as absence 
We need to prepare the background data. What is the background data? With Background data we are not attempting to guess point locations where an event is absent. Here, we are rather trying to characterise the environment of the study region. In this sense, background is the same, irrespective of where the point fire are found or not. Background data establishes the environmental domain of the study, whilst presence data should establish under which conditions a fire is more likely to be present than on average.
