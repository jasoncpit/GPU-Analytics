## Introduction 

Why are we interested in geospatial data? Geospatial data is a type of data that is associated with a location. This location can be a point, a line, a polygon, or a raster. Geospatial data is becoming more and more important, yet the sheer volume of information that is generated made it difficult to handle. In this chapter, we will be exploring the use of GPU for manipulating large-scale geospatial data, and provide a practical example of how we can predict the presence of Aedes aegypti across the globe. 
## Objectives 

The objective of the third *Case Study* is to demonstrate the practical application of the common spatial data structures and operation with GPU-accelerated Python packages. The goal here is in twofold: 1) compare the computational speed of calculating point in polygon and 2) compare the computational speed of a classification model with raster data. 

## Predicting the Presence of Aedes aegypti 
In this case study, we will be predicting the global presence and probability of Aedes aegypti, a mosquito species that is known to transmit dengue fever, chikungunya, and Zika virus. You can download the Aedes aegypti point occurrence data from the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/jasoncpit/GPU-Analytics/blob/master/data/Chapter3/aedes_point.csv). We will also be using precipitation, temperature, elevation, and population density to predict the presence of Aedes aegypti. You can download the raster data from the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/jasoncpit/GPU-Analytics/tree/master/data/Chapter3)

### Loading datasets 

```python
#Import libraries
import rasterio
import geopandas as gpd 
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
# Load raster data 
precipitation = rasterio.open('./data/Global Raster/Precipitation/Global Averaged Precipitation 2000-14.tif')
temp = rasterio.open('./data/Global Raster/Temperature/Global Averaged Temperature 2000-14.tif')
elevation = rasterio.open('./data/Global Raster/Elevation/Global Land Surface Elevation.tif')
#light = rasterio.open('./data/Rasters/Brazil Natural Lighting.tif')
pop_density = rasterio.open('./data/Global Raster/Population Density/Global Population Density AveragedEst.tif')
#urbanisation = rasterio.open('./data/Rasters/Brazil Urbanisation 2013.tif')  

# Load Shapefile 
global_outline =gpd.read_file('./data/Global Shapefile/Global Outline/Global_All_0.shp',crs='EPSG:4326')
country_outline = gpd.read_file('./data/Global Shapefile/Global with Country Outline/Global_Countries_1.shp',crs='EPSG:4326') 

# Load Point occurence data 
aedes =pd.read_csv('./data/Global Raster/aedes_point.csv')
aedes_point = gpd.GeoDataFrame(aedes,geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(aedes['longitude'],aedes['latitude']),crs='EPSG:4326')

# Transformation 
global_outline.crs = ('+init=EPSG:4326')
country_outline.crs =('+init=EPSG:4326')  
aedes_point.crs = ('+init=EPSG:4326')

print(global_outline.crs ==aedes_point.crs)
```

### Preparing data for pseudo-background points as absence 
We need to prepare the background data. What is the background data? With Background data we are not attempting to guess point locations where an event is absent. Here, we are rather trying to characterise the environment of the study region. In this sense, background is the same, irrespective of where the point fire are found or not. Background data establishes the environmental domain of the study, whilst presence data should establish under which conditions a fire is more likely to be present than on average.
