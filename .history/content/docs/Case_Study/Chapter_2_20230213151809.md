## GeoAI and Deep Learning 

GeoAI, or geospatial artificial intelligence (AI), has become a trending topic and the frontier for spatial analytics in Geography [(Li and Hsu, 2022)](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/11/7/385/pdf). Although the field of AI has experienced highs and lows in the past decades, it has recently gained tremendous momentum because of breakthrough developments in deep (machine) learning, immense available computing power, and the pressing needs for mining and understanding big data. 


## Objectives 

The objective of the second *Case Study* is to showcase how we can use GPU for satellite image classification. We will be discussing two case studies - (1) training a CNN model from scratch using Pytorch to detect land use classification from satellite images (2) using a pretrained computer vision model to understand the "scenicness" of images. While using a GPU is a commonly integrated into deep learning libraries, we will also provide best practices maximizing your training efficiency. 


## Case Study 1: Classifying EuraSat images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

In this case study, we will be using the EuraSat dataset to train a CNN model to classify land use from satellite images. The EuraSat dataset contains 27,000 images of 10 different land use classes. The dataset is available on Kaggle and can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/phylake1337/eurasat-land-use-and-land-cover). The dataset is also available on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html#eurasat).
